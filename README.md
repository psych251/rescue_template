# Replication Project Template

This is a GitHub template to use for replications projects in PSYCH 251. Create a new repo using this as a template in order to use it.

The template contains the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that you can run to remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.
